I think that there is a high chance that aliens exist in some form or another, whether that be intelligent life or simple life forms. I also think that aliens may have visited our planet at some point in the past, but there is no concrete evidence to support this claim.\n",

      "Pro:  There are a few ways to respond to this counter-argument. One could point to the many reports of unidentified flying objects throughout history and argue that aliens might be visiting our planet without leaving any concrete evidence behind. One could also argue that aliens might exist in a different form than what we typically imagine, making it difficult to find concrete evidence of their existence. Finally, one could simply state that lack of evidence is not proof that something does not exist, and that believing in aliens is a matter of faith.\n",
      "Con:  The first response would be to look at the reports of unidentified flying objects and try to find a natural explanation for them. The second response would be to argue that aliens might exist in a different form than what we typically imagine, making it difficult to find concrete evidence of their existence. The third response would be to simply state that lack of evidence is not proof that something does not exist, and that believing in aliens is a matter of faith.\n",
